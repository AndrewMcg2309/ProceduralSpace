# ProceduralSpace
For my assignment I have decided to go after a procedural space environment in Unity. My aim is to create an open environment filled with different types of planets being generated into it. 

## Background

### Inspiration

I first thought of this idea when I was looking over procedural oceans and cities. This led to me thinking of an open 
space with random planets of different sizes, colours and shapes bringing generated in a vast open space. This along with stars far off in the distance really give that space feel. 

Then a lot of ideas started coming to my head like shooting stars and comets. Shooting stars would be far away and show in a flash. Comets can be much bigger and in toughing distance but would have no effect on the user. The comets may then come in groups of 2 or 3.

This reminded me of videos like this:

Just looking through the different features of the planets made me think about generating randomly coloured a designed planet.

### Research

#### Planets
For research my first attempt thought was look for procedural planets. I found a great video of custom designed planets through shifting noise 
on the planet’s surface creating very life-like planets and moons. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoW8Tf7hTGA&ab_channel=morn1415)
The concepts he goes though in unity are also very interesting as well as his approach through creating the planets.
The picture below of random planets is the type of direction i am heading. Where you can then free roam and fly around them. 
The beauty of doing randomly generated planets gives me a chance to try make some crazy looking ones. Adding rings and other elements may also make it stand out.

#### Stars
Next, I began to think about the stars. My ideal background would be randomly generated stars that you couldn’t reach. 
Each star would then be a of a random size between two low numbers to keep it realistic. Below is an image of my idea for distant stars to look.

### Music
For a little background music i was hoping to try do some sort of interstellar type music. Music may really help the user to immerse themself into the world.

### Shooting Star
For the shooting star there were a number of online ideas for it. All which could generate quite simply where a point in a random area has a flash that moves in a straight line of a distance not too small or too large with the trail of the flash following like below.

### Comets
The first thought in my head was Transformers 1 where the autobots start coming down to earth in giant objects on fire. Sadly, with space being a vacuum there can’t be any fire so I will need to have the comet spiralling to give it that realistic movement rather than just a fixed object moving. Transformers also inspired me to potentially put in 2 or 3 comets in a group all heading the same direction. This would give off as if somewhere a planet has exploded or collided with another and debris from it is flying off. For the comet I will try make them random colours (groups are the same colour) as well as looking quite moon-like as well as not perfectly spherical.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
