# ProceduralSpace
For my assignment I have decided to go after a procedural space environment in Unity.

## Background

### Inspiration

My first thoughts came when I was looking over procedural oceans ad cities. This lead to me thinking of an open 
space with random planets of different sized along with stars far off in the distance.

This reminded me of videos like this:

Just looking through the different features of the planets made me think about generating randomly colored a designed planets.



### Research

I got inspiration from a number of videos such as:
