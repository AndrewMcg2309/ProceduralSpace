# ProceduralSpace
For my assignment I have decided to go after a procedural space environment in Unity. My aim is to create an open environment filled with different types of planets being generated into it. 

## Background

### Inspiration

I first thought of this idea when I was looking over procedural oceans ad cities. This lead to me thinking of an open 
space with random planets of different sizes, colors and shapes beinging generated in a vast open space. This along with stars far off in the distance really give that space feel. 

Then a lot of ideas started coming to my head like shooting stars and commets. Shooting stars would be far away and show in a flash. Commets can be much bigger and in toughing distance but would have no effect on the user. 

This reminded me of videos like this:

Just looking through the different features of the planets made me think about generating randomly colored a designed planets.



### Research

#### Planets
For research my first attmempt thought was look for procedural planets. I found a great video of custom designed planets through shifting noise 
on the planets surface creating very life-like planets and moons. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoW8Tf7hTGA&ab_channel=morn1415)
The concepts he goes though in unity are also very interesting as well as his approach through creating the planets.
The picture below of random planets is the type of direction i am heading. Where you can then free roam and fly around them. 
The beauty of doing randomly generated planets gives me a chance to try make some crazy looking ones. Adding rings and other elements may also make it stand out.

#### Stars
Next I began to think about the stars. My ideal background would be randomly generated stars that you couldnt reach. 
Each star would then be a of a random size between two low numbers to keep it realistic. Below is an image of my idea for distant stars to look.

### Music
For a little background music i was hoping to try do some sort of intersteller type music. Music may really help the user to immerse themself into the world.

### Shooting Star
For the shooting star there were a number of online ideas for it. All which could generated quite simply where a point in a random area has a flash that moves in a straight line of a distance not to small or too large with the trail of the flash following like below.
